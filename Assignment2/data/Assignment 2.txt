Assignment 2. 
Implement the following on the same data and compare it with the previous models. Additionally, I will upload data for one more problem soon (in a day or two). 

1. Linear models 

2. Logistic models 

3. Perceptron

4. FLDA 

5. Multi class discriminative models 

6. Support vector machines 

Please don't expect that all topics should be covered before the release of any assignment. You get started and the topics will be eventually covered. It is impractical to do it in such a way.
